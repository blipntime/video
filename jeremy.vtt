00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.000
Jeremy and I just moved into a great
new place in the city way love

2
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.000
everything about it except our old
mattress way found the signature sleep

3
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.000
mattress was a perfect choice for our
small urban space.

4
00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:18.000
And our budget

5
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.000
delivery right to our front stoop was
an option.

6
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.000
But we saved even more money by

7
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:24.000
picking it up.

8
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.000
It took some doing to convince Jeremy

9
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:28.000
we didn't need movers for this.

10
00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.000
Our signature sleep mashes came in a
lightweight, easy to transport box. It

11
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:33.000
fits

12
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
perfectly in our little car, and when
we got home couldn't have been easier

13
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:38.000
to unpack,

14
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:40.000
unroll,

15
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.000
let it expand

16
00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.000
and set it up.

17
00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.000
Jeremy even said you were right.
